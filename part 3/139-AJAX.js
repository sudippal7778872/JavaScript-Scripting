/* AJAX - Asynchronous JavaScript And XML
AJAX is a "set of web development technique" which we use in client side to create 
Asynchronous web Application.

HTTP request


with Ajax,web application can send and retrive the data from a server asynchronously
(in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the
existing page.


we dont use data in XML format anymore.
we use JSON now.


we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server :-
1. xmlHTTPRequest(old way if doing)
2. fetch API (new way of doing)
3. axios (third paty library)
